class BurstForwarder:
	""" Performs burst forwarding between transceivers.

	BurstForwarder distributes bursts between the list of given
	FakeTRX (Transceiver) instances depending on the following
	parameters of each transceiver:

	  - execution state (running or idle),
	  - actual RX / TX frequencies,
	  - list of active timeslots.

	Each to be distributed L12TRX message is being transformed
	into a TRX2L1 message, and then forwarded to transceivers
	with partially initialized header. All uninitialized header
	fields (such as rssi and toa256) shall be set by each
	transceiver individually before sending towards the L1.
